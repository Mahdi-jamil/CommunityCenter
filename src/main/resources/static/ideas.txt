            sort=top, old, new, Sort by Best:
                            Sorting by best involves a more nuanced algorithm that considers factors beyond just the number of upvotes or engagement.
                            In addition to considering the quantity of votes, it might also take into account factors such as the ratio of upvotes to downvotes or the recency of the votes.
                            The goal of sorting by best is to surface content that not only has a high number of votes but also maintains a high level of approval relative to the engagement it receives.
                            This sorting method aims to highlight content that is both popular and consistently well-received by the community, potentially offering a more balanced representation of quality content.

    Trigger
        1-Create a trigger function to update the number_of_members column:

           CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_community_members()
           RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
           BEGIN
               IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
                   UPDATE community
                   SET number_of_members = number_of_members + 1
                   WHERE community_id = NEW.community_id;
               ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
                   UPDATE community
                   SET number_of_members = number_of_members - 1
                   WHERE community_id = OLD.community_id;
               END IF;
               RETURN NULL;
           END;
           $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

           Create a trigger for the user_community table:

           CREATE TRIGGER update_community_members_trigger
           AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON user_community
           FOR EACH ROW
           EXECUTE FUNCTION update_community_members();
