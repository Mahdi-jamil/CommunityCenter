    Trigger
        1-Create a trigger function to update the number_of_members column:

           CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_community_members()
           RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
           BEGIN
               IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
                   UPDATE community
                   SET number_of_members = number_of_members + 1
                   WHERE community_id = NEW.community_id;
               ELSIF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
                   UPDATE community
                   SET number_of_members = number_of_members - 1
                   WHERE community_id = OLD.community_id;
               END IF;
               RETURN NULL;
           END;
           $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

           Create a trigger for the user_community table:

           CREATE TRIGGER update_community_members_trigger
           AFTER INSERT OR DELETE ON user_community
           FOR EACH ROW
           EXECUTE FUNCTION update_community_members();
